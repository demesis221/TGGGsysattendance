INSTRUCTIONS TO FIX server.js:

1. Open server.js
2. Find line 2214: const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
3. CUT all lines from 2217 to the end (the department tasks endpoints)
4. PASTE them BEFORE line 2214 (before const PORT)
5. In the POST /api/department-tasks endpoint, change line:
   FROM: const { task, description, deadline, priority } = req.body;
   TO: const { task, description, start_date, deadline, priority } = req.body;
6. Add start_date to the insert:
   FROM: suggested_by: req.user.id,
         deadline,
   TO: suggested_by: req.user.id,
       start_date,
       deadline,
7. Save and restart the server

The endpoints must be registered BEFORE app.listen() is called!
